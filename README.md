This is a plugin for Intellij Idea that adds a "Rename commit" button to the top of the Git section of the main menu.
The plugin consists of one action. Currently the action opens the Commit window and modifies the message using VcsDataKeys.COMMIT_MESSAGE_CONTROL. This might not work in newer versions.
